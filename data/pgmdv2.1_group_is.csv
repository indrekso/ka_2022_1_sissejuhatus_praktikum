Anyanya II formed in the late 1970s and was first a name covering a series of independent groups. Ethiopia assisted some of them and those that were assisted began to bring discipline to the others by 1982. In 1983, the SPLA was formed and backed by Ethiopia; some Anyanya II resisted incorporation and their leaders allied in 1983 with the Sudanese government for military and political support. Not all Anyanya II blocks allied with the government; only Anyanya II commander Paulino Matiep was permanently allied with the government.";"The main purpose of the Anyanya II was to fight rebel groups (esp. SPLA (John Grang) and SPLM/A). The Sudanese government used the Anyanya II because it was strategically well located to attack SPLA recruits on their way to and from Ethiopian training camps. The Anyanya II was used as a surrogate force to keep SPLA presence at a minimum and to provide a buffer zone against SPLA incursions into the oilfields from the Dinka and SPLM/A stronghold in Bahr El Ghaza. Additionally, government alliance with the Anyanya II was part of a broader “divide and displace/destroy” policy to generate divisions among the rebels and thereby allow government the possibility to access to some oilfields (Human Rights Watch 2003). News sources add that the Anyanya II was lauded for providing support for the armed forces and the popular defence forces. This assistance, also in sending relief material to citizens in the southern part of Sudan, spared the armed forces’ efforts and was a reason for government alliance with the group.";"A news source from 1987 estimates that there are 15,000 fighters in the Anyanya II.";"Anyanya II received support from the Defence Ministry and engaged in joint actions with the regular armed forces. It also had links to Maj-Gen Sayyid al-Husayni Abd al-Karim, the Governor of Kordofan. In return for guarding oilfields against rebel attacks, the Anyanya II received substantial material benefits from the Sudanese government. In 1988, the SPLA captured the Anyanya II base in Mayom; the government then sent Lt. Gen. Omar El Bashir with army reinforcements to recapture the Anyanya II base from the rebels. As a consequence, a personal bond was forged between Omar el Bashir and the Anyanya II leader Paulino Matiep. This bond became more significant after Bashir became Sudanese President after a military coup in 1989 (Human Rights Watch 2003).

A small group of EDF remained loyal to the Sudanese Armed Forces and continued to receive salaries and supplies from the SAF. In 2006, some parts of these EDF remnants were allegedly in negotiations with the SPLA; other remnant EDF commanders were to leave for Khartoum (Young 2006). It is not clear whether these plans were eventually fulfilled. Nor is it clear whether these remnants Young (2006) describes correspond to the EDF 2 faction Schomerus (2008) mentions.

In 1997, the MQM was a coalition party of the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Moslem League (PML). MQM demanded many concessions in return for its support, and when Sharif did not deliver, violence augmented.

"121";186;"Janjaweed";"Sudan";625;"Africa";"The Janjaweed existed since the 1980s, when they were an armed group of nomadic Arab tribes fighting over land and water with African farmers. News sources mention that the government already used Arab militias against dissidents in the 1980s and early 1990s, but they do not explicitly mention the Janjaweed, although they might imply them. The first clear evidence of Janjaweed being pro-government goes back to the 1996-1998 war between Masalit and Arabs. Back then the Janjaweed are mentioned to be organized by the government and to collaborate with the army (UCDP). A news source calls the Janjaweed a government-backed militia in 2000 and 2001. The Janjaweed became important after 2003 when the government started using them in large-scale anti-insurgency operations (Human Rights Watch 2004a).";"Officially, the Sudanese government told the Janjaweed that their purpose was to defend themselves from the insurgents. The main purpose of the Janjaweed was to support the Sudanese government’s counterinsurgency campaign in the Darfur region (Human Rights Watch 2004a). As they are mainly used to commit atrocities against civilians who belong to the same ethnic group as the insurgents, it has been suggested that the real purpose of the Janjaweed was to terrorize civilians (Amnesty International 2006c), allowing the government to deny its involvement in such violence (Amnesty International 2006a). The Janjaweed also had better knowledge of desert warfare than the regular army (UCDP) and the Sudanese government has used them as proxy-force on the ground. In 2014, President Bashir used the Janjaweed to counter the decreasing loyalty of the Sudanese Armed Forces.";"A news source from April 2004 says that the government recruited and armed more than 20,000 Janjaweed. Another news source, from March 2005, reports the government asking Musa Hilal to mobilise 300,000 tribesmen as Janjaweed.";"The Janjaweed closely cooperate with the Sudanese army, and enjoy air support through aerial bombardment and helicopter reconnaissance before and after their operations. News sources say that Janjaweed members in the field are led by top army commanders who in turn receive orders from the Western command center and from Khartoum. They have connections to high levels of the civilian administration which organized the Janjaweed’s recruitment, support and impunity. Several directives concerning the Janjaweed were issued by the governor of South Darfur. The governor also formed a security committee to increase levels of recruitment; the committee includes leaders of tribes contributing to the Janjaweed (Human Rights Watch 2004a). In December 2003 Sudanese President Bashar mentioned using the Janjaweed in a speech. The Janjaweed’s main leader, Musa Hilal, also has a direct relationship to the government (Amnesty International 2006a). Musa Hilal is leader of the Jalul tribe in North Darfur and leader of a supremacist organization called the Tajamu al Arab (translations differ: Arab Gathering, Arab Alliance, Arab Congregation, or Arab Congress). Tajamu al Arab allegedly has contact to intelligence services of some Arab countries (UCDP). News sources report that the Janjaweed fighters are organized into battalions with the same structure as the regular army. In 2004, many Janjaweed were incorporated into the army and the Popular Defence Forces (PDF), which is coded as separate PGM. Still, the Janjaweed are continued to be referred to as an independent group; one news source says they were PDF by day and Janjaweed by night. Their inclusion into the PDF aimed at making the Janjaweed disappear from the public eye while allowing them to remain active.";"News sources suggests that most Janjaweed members are motivated by material rewards they receive from the government for participation. Those who are not eligible for monthly salaries (for example Janjaweed who are not formally part of the Border Intelligence Guard or the Popular Defense Force) are still rewarded with new weapons and impunity for looting, killing and raping in the context of the military operations (Amnesty International 2006a). Additionally, many nomadic Arab Janjaweed have an intrinsic interest in participating the Darfur conflict, as they had been involved in clashes with African farmers in previous years. Through the Janjaweed, they can obtain land and livestock for their herds (Human Rights Watch 2004a).";3e+05;"Janjaweed literally means “ghosts/devils on horseback”; alternative transcriptions include Gangawied, Jingaweit and Janjawid. As the name is perceived as an insult, Janjaweed members prefer to call themselves Border Intelligence Guard, Second Reconnaissance Brigade, “the Quick and the Horrible”, Peshmerga (Western Darfur), Fursan  (horsemen) or mujahedeen. As recognized by the UN International Commission of Inquiry, “Janjaweed” is a catch-all term for pro-government Arab militias that enjoy impunity for their actions (Amnesty International 2006a). Janjaweed are mostly nomad Arab camel-herding tribes from North Darfur who had originally come to the region in the 1970s from Chad and Western Africa (Human Rights Watch 2004a). Over time, smaller, often African, tribes that were disadvantaged by the traditional administrative system joined the Janjaweed (Amnesty International 2006b). The Janjaweed also operate in eastern Chad. In 2007, there was heavy fighting among Arab tribes which are part of the Janjaweed. There is one report which states that the Jangaweed are also active in Upper Nile State. However, there is no additional information about events in Upper Nile.

In 2004, government helicopters brought weapons and ammunitions, as well as other provisions to the main camp in Mistriya three times a week (Human Rights Watch 2004a). According to a news source from 2007, the African Union commander in Nyala, in South Darfur said that the Sudanese government was no longer arming the Janjaweed. Another news source dated 2004, citing Jaffer Monro, a MP for the ruling National Congress, says the Janjaweed receive proper military training from the government.";".";"";"dy";"The Janjaweed committed numerous human rights abuses against civilians, to a degree that the United Nations termed is ethnic cleansing. In joint actions with the Sudanese army, the Janjaweed committed extrajudicial executions (Amnesty International 2006a). The Janjaweed displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians from their homes, as well as looted and appropriated their land. The displaced were kept in IDP camps, which the Janjaweed guarded. Any men who fled faced beatings, torture and death, while women leaving the camp to collect wood were sometimes enslaved to serve in a Janjaweed members’ household and/or were raped. Men were also subjected to sexual violence. The police did not pursue the Janjaweed for these actions, stating that they were powerless compared to the Janjaweed; sometimes, the police were complicit in the crimes. Janjaweed also committed atrocities against civilians in Eastern Chad (Amnesty International 2006b). The war crimes committed against civilians by the Janjaweed were authorized at the highest level of the state bureaucracy. The official role of the Janjaweed around the IDP camps was to protect civilians (Human Rights Watch 2004a). News sources report that the Janjaweed primarily targeted members of the Four, Zaghawa and Massaleet ethnic groups and that the actions taken against the civilians were part of the government’s scorched earth campaign, explaining the full impunity the Janjaweed enjoyed. In 2009, the International Criminal Court charged Ali Kushayb, an alleged Janjaweed leader for war crimes, but the Sudanese government refused to cooperate with the ICC (Amnesty International 2013). The Janjaweed’s presence and actions contributed to an escalation of violence: In response to the attacks by the Janjaweed against civilians and the failed government protection, the SLA and the Justice and Equality Movement began attacking Sudanese government in 2003. As a consequence, the Sudanese government initiated the Janjaweed-backed scorched earth campaign (Amnesty International 2006b).";0;"Amnesty International. 2006a. “Beyond any doubt: Sudan uses and supports the Janjawid in Darfur.” AI Index: IOR 41/028/2006.

Information was taken from news sources listed in the PGMD";"In 2004, the UN Security Council demanded in Resolution 1556 the disarmament of the Janjaweed militias. The Sudanese government subsequently pledged to disarm the Janjaweed, but did not comply with the resolution, as no real disarmament followed (Human Rights Watch 2004b). Instead, it absorbed some of the Janjaweed members into the police and different paramilitary forces in Darfur (Human Rights Watch 2004a). In 2007, some Janjaweed leaders reportedly joined rebel groups because they did not receive the land, cattle and money which the Sudanese government had promised. News sources continue to refer to the Janjaweed as pro-government. In 2014, President al-Bashir reconstituted the Janjaweed as Rapid Support Forces (UCDP).

After the end of the Communist government it was used to support the government with security related tasks. In the 1990s it mainly fought the Taliban. As part of the Northern Alliance, it was an instrument for the US to combat terrorism perpetrated by the Taliban and al-Quaeda. Later it was suggested that the PGM should be used to counter insurgents in the south of Afghanistan, even though it was already supposed to have disarmed, and was predominantly intended to counter the Taliban. Dostum also rallied support for Karzai in his electoral campaign, e.g. by holding pro-Karzai rallies.";"During their fight against the Mujahideen the group is estimated to have included about 40,000 members. In 1992 it is reported that there were 75,000 fighters of the militia guarding Kabul. In 2004, when the disarmament process was initiated, a source estimates that the PGM had at least 8,400 members.";"At various points in times, the group’s leader Dostum occupied positions within the government such as military adviser (of security in the north), chief of staff to the commander of the armed forces, and deputy defence minister, all under Karzai. He switched sides several times prior to becoming part of the Northern Alliance. Dostum is said to have held significant power in the northern provinces under his influence. During its time as a member of the Northern Alliance, the PGM also received financial backing from the US/CIA.";"There is evidence indicating that membership was ethnically motivated, with the group having a mainly Uzbek (the ethnicity of its leader) membership base. This is also supported by the fact that it was used to rally Uzbek support in electoral campaigns for Karzai. Members also looted civilians which is another potential incentive to join the group.";75000;"The group’s sources of support changed over time. It received support from the Soviet Union in the 1980s, which matches references to fighting throughout this time for the Soviet side. In 2001 it became part of the Northern Alliance and subsequently was supported by the US. Dostum is a general described as Soviet trained and the group also has a political arm in the form of a party. Reports state that he used the militia to secure his own interests. His appointment as deputy defence minister sparked controversy and he was supposed to be put on trial, although this was thought to have too much of a destabilizing impact. The PGM is often referred to simply as “Uzbek militia” because this is the ethnic group of most members. The militia operated mainly in northern Afghanistan (based in the Jowzjan province) and has been in control of cities such as Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif. In 2009, Karzai used the group to rally support of ethnic Uzbeks in his electoral campaign.

In the 1980s, its main purpose became supporting the regular Army in the war against Iran. After it was re-established in 1992, its purpose shifted to confronting political opposition. The Jerusalem Army had the official aim of liberating Jerusalem from Israel, but its real purpose was to control the rebellious youth. It was also used to absorb discarded military officers in order to keep them away from army positions and decision-making positions.";"By 1977, the Popular Army had 50,000 active members. In 1980, the militia had close to 400,000 members. In 1982, the group was estimated to reach 500,000 by the end of that year with numbers gradually increasing. In 1988, a news source reports 450,000 men. When the PGM was disbanded in 1991, it had 800,000 members; another news source mentions one million. In 1998, Hussein called for a million volunteers. In 2003, Iraqi authorities said the Jerusalem Army had 6.5 million volunteer members. A news source says that in 2003, there were 150,000 members in Baghdad alone. Another source mentions that the Iraqi authorities claimed a membership of seven million, but that this seize was most likely only propaganda.";"In the 1980s, the head of the Popular Army and its commander-in-chief was Taha Yasin Ramadan, the First Deputy Prime Minister. Saddam Hussein also supported the group. The Popular army was supervised by the Baath party. Although theoretically under Baath Party command, the group was subordinate to General Adnan Khairallah, the armed forces chief of staff, according to a source of 1988. Al-Rawi was the chief of staff of the Jerusalem Army. Rammadan was still a commander of the group in 2003, but had become a secondary figure by then.";"Officially, membership was voluntary, and many men are reported to have actively sought membership. However, there were also cases of civilians being coerced into membership. In one occasion, Sudanese citizens who had their papers not in order were ordered into the Popular Army. Students and teachers were pressured to “volunteer”. In 2002, civilians were told their money and property would be seized if they left Baghdad, in a move to lessen incentives for citizens to avoid conscription.

In early November 2008 the Sahwa were turned over to the Iraqi authorities (Benraad 2011), becoming pro-government according to the PGMD definition.

From 2007 to 2008, they were considered very successful in reducing violence (Benraad 2011). They were also considered being a counterbalance to the Shi’i-dominated forces of the Interior ministry and its allies. The government and the Coalition forces allied with the tribes because it was cheaper and more effective to buy them than to fight them (Ahram 2015).";"After one year, the number of Sahwa increased to 80,000 members. Since 2009, thousands defected and rejoined al-Qaeda, fearing the jihadists’ intimidations and threats. As of 2010, there were 94,000 Sahwa members (Benraad 2011).

Sahwa Tribes were allowed to implement tribal law dominion and act as mediator between the people and the state (Ahram 2015). In early November 2008, the Sahwa were transferred to Iraqi authority. Prime Minister al-Maliki promised to integrate some of the Sahwa forces into a state apparatus, but he did not fully comply with this promise. The tribes participating in the Awakening had never been unified and local outfits had been very diverse (Benraad 2011).

As of 2014, the new prime minister Haider al-Abadi was planning to rebuild the Sahwa into a national guard, but the law had not yet been passed by parliament until end of 2014.";"Tribes initially allied with the US forces, because they saw an opportunity to obtain arms, training and alternative funding, which they could use to expel al-Qaeda, which had captured the Anbar tribes’ key resources. They were driven by economic motives, if not opportunism, of its members and not because of any tribal patriotism against al-Qaeda (Benraad 2011). A news source mentions that after a tribal leader was killed in summer 2006, 15 Ramadi sheiks formed a Sahwa for survival, demanding protection against al-Qaeda in return for providing policing.

"179";256;"Popular Defence Forces (PDF)";"Sudan";625;"Africa";"The origins of the PDF trace back to the armament of tribal militias in the 1980s (which later provided the bulk of PDF recruits) and the party militants and youth movements of the National Islamic Front (NIF), which constituted the ideological core and political use. The Popular Defence policy began with the armament of pro-government tribes to form militias in the mid-1980s. On February 20, 1989 the army’s commander-in-chief General Fathi Ahmed issued an ultimatum calling on the government to give greater support to the army, implying an end to support for the tribal militias. In response, Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi created a committee charged with establishing the legal foundations for existing units and the creation of a national paramilitary force. This led to the so-called Popular Defence Forces bill, which was proposed to the Constituent Assembly but rejected. Soon afterwards, in June 1989, the government was toppled in a coup by little-known, middle-ranking military officers affiliated to the NIF. In November, the National Salvation Regime revisited the previous government’s draft bill and passed the 1989 Popular Defence Forces Act. This formally created the PDF as an institution of the state.  (Salmon 2007)";"According to Article 5 of the 1989 Popular Defence Forces Act, the official purpose of the PDF is ‘to train citizens on military and civil capabilities, to raise security awareness and military discipline among them, in order to act as a support force to the other regular ones on request’. It has been suggested, including by news sources, that the real purpose of the PDF, at least in the 1990s, was to be an instrument of Islamic political and popular mobilization. While the rural PDF was mainly sent to fight against SPLM/A advances, the Urban PDF’s main task was to protect the regime from uprisings. The regime used the PDF as a tool to militarize local grievances through supporting local militias, which served the government’s policy of divide and rule. Moreover, the PDF was used as a praetorian guard to protect the regime from the coup-prone military. The regime also justified the use of the PDF by referring to its limited military capabilities and thereby relegated responsibility to local areas. In 1990s, the government praised the PDF for being effective in their fight against the SPLA (Salmon 2007). News sources also suggest that the government used PDF members as civilian shields to protect soldiers against the SPLA.";"It is difficult to obtain reliable numbers for the group’s size. Many recruits served in the PDF only for a short-term, typically three months. Some local recruits did not receive centralized training and are therefore not included in training estimates. Training was sometimes held at military bases, making it hard to distinguish the PDF from regular military. In rural areas there is only a blurred distinction between the PDF and other paramilitaries, especially because many recruits left the PDF without returning their weapons. Even government officials are reported to be unaware of PDF numbers. In theory, every Sudanese man above 16 years of age had to participate in PDF training in the 1990s; however, evidence suggests massive evasion of such training: in 1998, only 4,000 out of 70,000 legally obliged school leavers actually joined the PDF. In 1989, the first PDF coordinator announced that the PDF would enlist 100,000 fighters. In June 1993, the PDF numbers roughly matched the numbers of the Sudanese army forces in Southern Sudan. Estimates by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London suggest that the numbers of active fighters increased from 15,000 in 1992-93 to 40,000 in 1993-94. The number of active fighters then fell to 10,000 in 1995-1996 and remained constantly between 10,000 and 20,000 ever after (estimates are calculated until 2006). The decline of active fighters in the 1990s resulted from a high number of casualties combined with low recruitment rates. Reserve forces are estimated to number 60,000 until 1996-97, and then rose to a constant level 85,000 reserve recruits (Salmon 2007).";"Upon foundation, the PDF’s government-relation was codified in the Popular Defence Forces Act of 1989 (Human Rights Watch 2007). Back then, the PDF was closely linked to the National Islamic Front (NIF); however, this party link diminished over time. The protocol of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement formally affiliated the PDF with the Soudanese Armed Forces, but the PDF remained an independent institution directly under the authority of the president. The PDF exhibits a large complexity and informality that makes it difficult to identify clear command and control structures. In general, the PDF is structured around joint civil and military coordinating committees. While the civilian coordinators are responsible for mobilization and selection of volunteers, once mobilized, the military command falls under the authority of the local military commanding officer. The PDF is operationally accountable to an army brigadier (originally this was Brigadier Babiker Abd el-Mahmoud Hassan) and answerable directly to President Bashir. The division between civilian and military coordinator is in practice rather opaque, and tribal PDFs often act autonomously from army command. Tribal leaders are often recognized as PDF coordinators in a parallel hierarchy to the military and tribal PDFs are granted equal treatment and benefits as regular soldiers. In 1997, Ali Karti, the minister for justice, became national PDF coordinator. That same year, President Bashir established a higher authority for mobilization, led by Maj. Gen. Zubayr Muhammad Saleh, who reported directly to Bashir. The PDF are financed through companies which are connected to National Congress Party (NCP) officials, companies run by the National Security agency (al-Sharikat al-Amniya), through charities controlled by the NCP or by private donations from devout individuals (Salmon 2007). News sources from the 1990s report that the PDF received money from Islamic banks in Sudan and abroad and that the PDF was loyal to Sheikh Hassan al-Turabi. Al-Turabi made peace with the SPLM/A in the early 2000s, leading to a split between al-Turabi and the presidency. The PDF remained pro-government and subsequently became more reliant on NCP-channeled funds, including from ministries (Salmon 2007).";"Until 1997, all male Sudanese citizens over the age of 16 were required to attend PDF training. A certificate of training was the prerequisite for graduating from university, being employed in government institutions or large companies, or to travel abroad. Although actual combat was officially voluntary, some recruits were taken directly from training camps to the frontline against their will. This practice diminished since the mid-1990s. PDF mass recruitment strategies diminished in the late 1990s after an outcry in society after government security forces killed secondary school PDF conscripts who had broken out of the Eilafoun training camp to spend the Islamic holiday Eid al Adha with their families in 1998. There is evidence of massive evasion of forced conscription. Tribal PDF members were primarily interested in looting, but not willing to enter serious combat. When the PDF experienced immense casualties in the 1992-93 and the 1995 campaign against the SPLA, recruitment fell sharply. Frontline combat was promoted in mosques, the education system and the media. In 1992, the government declared the war a jihad. In the 2000s, the legitimacy of fighting for the PDF decreased after al-Turabi, the sole recognized Islamist intellectual in the regime made peace with the SPLA, which made it impossible for PDF casualties to be considered martyrs anymore. Tribal leaders began discouraging their youth from joining the PDF (Salmon 2007). News sources report that 10 and 11 year old boys were forcibly recruited and sent to combat. One news source from 2005 mentions that PDF members received salaries from the government.";1e+05;"The relationship and cooperation between the PDF and the regular army is very tight, and observer find it sometimes hard to distinguish between the PDF, the Janjaweed and the regular army (UCDP). News sources report that the PDF had been designed to eventually replace the regular army as Sudan’s primary defense organization. PDF members are drawn from Fellata and other nomadic ethnic groups (Human Rights Watch 2012). The PDF is an umbrella group encompassing other PGMs, including the Murahilin, the Janjaweed, Arab Baggara militias in general (Rizaygat, Missiriya, etc) and the Fertit Militiamen. As a consequence, the PDF is a very heterogenous group, which can be divided into five levels: an elite section similar to the Iranian Revolutionary Gurads, students and other civilians forced into the training camps, military officers and government officials forced to undergo PDF training for re-education, localized militias which are part of the PDF umbrella organization, and a network of informers. Despite the official minimum age for recruitment being 16 years, this minimum threshold was not seriously enforced, resulting in several cases of child soldiers. The PDF was most active during the 1990s, when it functioned as a pretorian force for the National Congress Party (NCP); in the 2000s, PDF activity decreased. It remained operational in areas of active conflict, such as Darfur, and became inactive reserve forces in other areas (Salmon 2007).";"Darfur, Southern Sudan (e.g., Blue Nile, Kordofan, Bahr el Ghazal), Eastern Sudan, Kit, Muglad";"mo";15000;"The PDF received arms from the government. In the first year of its operations, it was supplied directly by the regular army. As the PDF grew, it established an independent purchasing and supplies department, which was allocated with an autonomous budget controlled by the commander general. Their access to arms was controlled by an executive independent from the regular military (Salmon 2007). In 2012, it is mentioned that the PDF received their weapons from the Sudanese military (Amnesty International 2012). The PDF also issued weapons to tribal militias (Human Rights Watch 2007). Weapons include tanks and artillery (Salmon 2007), Ak-47s (Human Rights Watch 2012) and Chinese-manufactured small arms ammunition (Amnesty International 2012). Many PDF recruits received training. Training camps were supervised by pro-NIF military officers. Training differed by recruit type: The elite PDF section received tanks and artillery training; the students and civilians were taught the use and maintenance of small arms, as well as basic military tactics and ideological training; military officers and civil servants received re-education and indoctrination classes at the training camps. A training course typically lasted 45-60 days (Salmon 2007). According to news sources, the PDF received training from Iranian officers in 1992.";"National Islamic Front (NIF)/National Congress Party (NCP)";"";"dy";"The PDF regularly attacked villages, which they burnt and looted. During these attacks, they arbitrarily detained people, raped women, killed civilians or beat them (Human Rights Watch 2012, 2007). News sources mention that the PDF abducted southern children in Khartoum and forced them to be child soldiers. The PDF enslaved civilians, including women and children. Many village attacks were directed against the Dinka community. The actions of the PDF led to massive displacements of civilians (Salmon 2007). There is evidence for coordinated attacks with other government security forces. In 2011, the PDF, together with the government’s Central Reserve Police, shelled and bombed residential neighborhoods in Kadughi, where they killed civilians. This action amounted to crimes against humanity according to the UN’s Officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In November 2011, PDF soldiers raped two underage girls (Human Rights Watch 2012). The government is considered to be unwilling to protect civilians and to prevent the PDF from attacking them. With the formation of the PDF, overall levels of violence increased (Human Rights Watch 2007). The PDF actions were ordered by their commanders. The ICC seeks to indict the PDF coordinator Ali Kushayb of war crimes (Salmon 2007); Ahmed Harun, the governor of South Kurdufan, used the PDF to attack the village of his political rival; and Captain Ginat, commander of the PDF and a member of the Sudanese government council in Wao, ordered attacks against Dinka villages in 1993.";0;"Amnesty International. 2012. “Darfur: New weapons from China and Russia fuelling conflict.” February 8. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/darfur-new-weapons-china-and-russia-fuelling-conflict/

The use of the Murahaleen by the government became more significant in 1985. Tribal leaders participated in the mobilization of this militia force, but ultimately the Sudanese government and army organized and supplied the group. Subsequent governments continued to support the Murahaleen (Bureau of African Affairs 2002).";"The main purpose of the Murahaleen was to fight the SPLM/A rebels. Additionally, Murahaleen were engaged by the government to protect a seasonal military supply train between Babanusa and Wau (Bureau of African Affairs 2002). The government also aligned with the Murahaleen to give them the opportunity to loot their richer neighbors in the South, diminishing the potential threat impoverished Murahaleen could pose. This strategy yielded access to Southern resources such as oil, water and grazing land. In the early 1980s, the government also tasked the Murahaleen with protecting oil fields of the Chevron company (Human Rights Watch 2003). News sources report that the government used the Murahaleen to harass Dinka civilians. Murahaleen were also used to increase instability in Southern Sudan and make the area ungovernable for the incoming SPLM/A administration. Mobilizing the Murahaleen was cheaper for the government than using the army and allowed the government to dismiss the war as a ‘tribal problem’ unrelated to national policies. The government could deny responsibility of violence the Murahaleen committed, which was a major reason for them being used to accompany the military supply train (Bureau of African Affairs 2002). The government used the Murahaleen to do the fighting and thereby kept their Northern conscripts away from the frontline.";"One news source from 1989 reports an attack by 3,000 Murahaleen militia members.";"The Murahaleen were organized and supplied by the Sudanese government and the Sudanese army, while tribal leaders participated in its mobilization. Support for the Murahaleen grew during Sadiq al Mahdi's government, whose Umma party was in turn supported by the Baggara and Murahaleen. The army became preoccupied with this Umma-Murahaleen relationship, and as pressure grew the National Salvation government passed the National Popular Defense Act to regularize militias. The Act legalized the Popular Defense Force (PDF) to assist army operations, and the Murahaleen became part of the PDF. Consequently, the relationship between official forces and militias blurred even more. As the Murahaleen continue to act independently from the PDF, it is reasonable to assume that this act was rather pro-forma to satisfy criticism. The Sudanese army regularly conducts joint actions with PDF and Murahaleen. (Bureau of African Affairs 2002). Murahaleen received the permission to steal from the Nuer and Dinka goods and people (as slaves) in return for their service to the government (Human Rights Watch 2003). They are led by the hardline Muslim Sultan Abd al-Baqi Ayiei and his son Husayn Abd al-Baqi.";"Members of the Murahaleen were usually not paid regular salaries. Instead, they were compensated with cash incentives from the Ministry of Defense (especially since late 2000) and had the permission to loot. Between 1985 and 1988, the government’s interests coincided with the interest of the Baggara, who had been heavily affected by the 1984/1985 Sahelian drought. During the raids into Dinka territory, the Baggara could take cattle and abduct civilians as slaves. The gains from looting and abducting people were the most important incentive for joining the Murahaleen. By taking part in the Murahaleen, it was possible to protect one’s tribe against the SPLM/A. (Bureau of African Affairs 2002)";3000;"The term Murahaleen originally refers to young men who travel ahead of their family and their cattle to protect the migration routes and to identify pasture and upcoming threats. The Murahaleen militia is also known as Baggara militia, quwat al fursan (horse mounted forces, Rizeigat al fusan (meaning brave)  and um bagha (refers to a water bottle carried by the militia) (Bureau of African Affairs 2002). Alternative spellings include Murahilyn, Murahilin, Murahiliin and Muraheleen.

They transferred the abductees to other communities, subjecting them to unpaid forced labor, renaming, forced religious conversion, involuntary circumcision and the like. Their practice of abduction amounted to enslavement (Bureau of African Affairs 2002); some of the abducted disappeared. News sources from the late 1980s report that the Murahaleen prevented the local population from taking water from the river and water wells, leading to many people dying of thirst. In the 1990s, the Murahaleen, in concert with the army, engaged in massive forced displacements in Western Upper Nile/Unity State (Human Rights Watch 2003). Murahaleen raided villages where they looted property and abducted, raped, mutilated and killed civilians. The raids occurred on such a large scale that they are considered to have caused famine and widespread displacement in northern Bahr al Ghazal in 1986 and 1987 famine. The government did not prevent the Murahaleen from committing the crimes and continued to supply them with weapons.

"182";259;"South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF)";"Sudan";625;"Africa";"In 1997, SPLM breakaway factions united in Khartoum to form one front, which was also known as United Democratic Salvation Front. In 1997, these militias signed the Khartoum Peace Agreement and thereby became a formalized pro-government umbrella organization with the name South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) (Arnold 2007). Signatories of the Khartoum Peace Agreement were the South Sudan Independent Movement/Army (SSIM/A) of Dr. Riek Machar, Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (Bahr al-Ghazal group) of Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, Kawa Makwel-led South Sudan Independent Group (SSIG), Equatorial Defence Force (EDF) of Dr. Theophilus Ochang Loti, the Union of African Parties (USAP) led by Mr. Samuel Aru Bol and the Alliance of Bor Citizens led by Arok Thon Arok.";"The SSDF fulfilled several purposes for the Sudanese government: The SSDF contributed to generate general instability in the South and thereby function as political argument against the SPLA. The instability also functioned as an argument to delay the withdrawal of Sudanese troops from the South (Arnold 2007). The government profited from the two ideologically rebel factions – SSDF and SPLA – fighting within the government’s policy of promoting internal divide. Moreover, the government profited from the SSDF’s control of southern territory to gain access to oil fields (UCDP). The SSDF was considered to be the most effective tool in the government’s fight against the SPLA. They were much cheaper than using official government forces. As SSDF members died in action, the death of government forces could be averted and political costs for the government were reduced (Young 2006).";"According to a news source from 2004, the SSDF was comprised of about 25 militias that had several thousand members who could mobilise thousands more. At its peak, the SSDF comprised a significant number of members. Estimating membership is problematic, as recruitment of some groups was ongoing and the SSDF member groups were non-regular forces, making the dividing line between civilians and combatants very grey. Some fighters identified themselves as affiliated with the group at one point, but did not adhere to the SSDF anymore after a certain objective was achieved. Although a large majority of SSDF joined the SPLA after the Juba Declaration, the informal SSDF loyal to the army still numbered around 6,000 (Young 2006). The actual number of SSDF membership prior to 2006 was thus probably much higher.";"Cooperation between the Sudanese government and the SSDF was formalized in the Khartoum peace agreement. It allowed rebel factions to keep their militias in exchange for helping the government fight the rebel SPLA. The SSDF had little internal coherence; this lack of coherence was actively supported by the Sudanese Armed Forces who bypassed the SSDF command structure to interact directly with individual commanders. Individual soldiers were under the direct control of their respective commanders and did not respond to an overarching chain of command. SSDF units had little day-to-day contact between each other, except for senior officers in larger cities. Many SSDF commanders held formal positions in the SAF (Arnold 2007). They were rapidly promoted in order to gain allegiance. In contrast, rank and file soldiers were only supplied by the army with weapons and left for looting in order to promote antagonistic relations in the local community (Young 2006). The SAF was the near exclusive supplier of material support to the SSDF. The SSDF’s leaders were Riek Machar (until he defected in January 2000), Jathum Jathum, Gatlauk Deng, and especially near 2005, Paulino Matiep (Arnold 2007).";"Recruitment occurred locally and was personality and ethnicity driven. Many SSDF members were convinced that their force would be necessary until independence of South Sudan was assured. SSDF commanders received direct cash payments from the Sudanese Armed Forces. Senior commanders also received houses and cars in Khartoum. Some SSDF commanders, such as the Murle commander Ismail Konyi, passed parts of their payments down to their soldiers, but this was not the case for all SSDF members (Arnold 2007). The payment, together with fears of Dinka domination through the SPLA and the dislike of the rule of rule of John Garang, were motivations for SSDF members (Young 2006).";50000;"SSDF is an umbrella organisation that unites Southern militias in their struggle against the SPLM/A. Members (25 in total): SSIM/A, SSUM/A, SSIG, SPLA Bahr el Ghazal, Bor Group, EDF, USAP, Murle Forces, Mundari Commandos, SSDF Tanginya, Thourjikany Forces, SSLM/A, etc (remaining are unknown). Some of these groups still act independently (SSIM/A, SSUM/A, SPLA Bahr el Ghazal, EDF, Murle Forces, Mundari Commandos, SSDF Tanginya, Thourjikany Forces, SSLM/A) and are coded separately. The political wing of the SSDF is the United Democratic Salvation Front (UDSF). Many SSDF militias are based in oil-rich Upper Nile. In contrast to the SPLA, which fought the government but advocated for a unified Sudan, the Khartoum-allied SSDF fought for Southern independence. The SSDF leadership was mostly Nuer, although there were also significant numbers of Dinka members (Arnold 2007). The Khartoum Agreement gave SSDF members a sense of identity, a rationale for their tactical alliance with the government, and a measure of assurance that others would come to their defence if they were attacked (Young 2006).";"Southern Sudan (e.g., Eastern Equatoria, Unity, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei, Upper Nile)";"yr";6000;"The SSDF mainly used small arms and a limited number of mortars and heavy machine guns.

Originally a rebel group from Uganda, it crossed the border into Sudan to escape from fighting and continued operating in the border region of both countries. In 1993, the Sudanese Armed Forces made the LRA its proxy force (Schomerus 2012). Since 1994, the LRA received military and logistic support from the government in Sudan (Amnesty International 1997, 1999).";"The main purpose of the LRA was to assist the Sudanese army in its fight against the SPLM/A rebels. Another reason why the government used the LRA was to destabilize Uganda, where the LRA was a rebel group fighting against the government, in retaliation for Ugandan support for the SPLM/A in Sudan. (Amnesty International 1999, UCDP)";"Estimating the size of the PGM is difficult: First, the LRA was active in various countries and most estimates do not indicate how many of the LRA were in Sudan. Second, the group size fluctuated a lot depending on abductions, which was the main method of recruitment. Third, it is not clear how many LRA members were fighting, as a part of the abductees was only used as porters. According to UCDP, the LRA had a few hundred members in 1994, which gradually increased to 1,000 in 1995, 2,000 in 1996, out of which half were in Sudan, 2,000-4,000 in 1997 and up to 6,000 in 1998. In 2000, the LRA had around 1,500 members, in 2001 it had up to 1,500 members, out of which 1,300 were in Sudan. It remained relatively constant at 1,500 until 2004, when the maximum estimate reached 3,000 (UCDP LRA Group Archive). According to a soldier of the Sudanese army, the LRA had around 10,000 soldiers in 2002 (Schomerus 2012). News sources estimate 1,500 followers in 1995, and 4,000-7,000 in 2003.";"In return for fighting for against the SPLM/A in Sudan, the LRA received food, weapons and ammunitions from the Sudanese government. These provisions allowed it to be a lethal force in Sudan and to sustain its fight in Uganda (Schomerus 2012).

The LRA also conducted several large-scale massacres of civilians in Sudan, including one in 2002 where 520 people were killed. Additionally, people went missing after their raids (Schomerus 2012). News sources report that the LRA was known for terrorizing tactics such as mutilating civilians by cutting of body parts.

Although legalised during Gaviria’s presidency, the PGM was mainly developed during the administration of Ernesto Samper Pizano (Wikipedia “Convivir”) in August 1994. Some Convivir groups were formed by paramilitary leaders (Human Rights Watch 2002). According to news sources, individuals asked for a license to provide their own security in order to form a convivir (Human Rights Watch 2009). According to a news source, regional governor and later president Uribe helped establish Convivir groups.";"The main purpose of the Convivir was to provide security against guerillas in areas where there was no need for a large military force or illegal paramilitary presence (Wikipedia “Right-wing paramilitarism in Colombia”). Another purpose was to gathering intelligence on guerilla and criminal activities and provide it to security forces. Civilian opposition say the real purpose was to legitimize underground paramilitary groups and harness their terror tactics to the army’s fight against rebels. According to then-regional Governor Uribe, Convivir helped to cut crime and violence sharply. A relative benefit was their local presence, as they substituted government forces to provide security in some regions where the state did not guarantee public safety (Human Rights Watch 2009).";"Estimates on PGM size differ significantly. There were over 500 Convivir groups, and membership is estimated in the wide range from 10,000 to 120,000 (Wikipedia “Right-wing paramilitarism in Colombia”). A news source estimated that at their peak, there were at least 15,000 people involved in Convivir groups.";"Convivir was supported by the regional governor of Antioquia, <U+00C1>lvaro Uribe Velez (Wikipedia “Convivir”). Convivir worked alongside the Colombian military and illegal paramilitary groups in counterinsurgency operations (Wikipedia “Right-wing paramilitarism in Colombia”). In general, Convivir groups were poorly supervised and regulated (Human Rights Watch 2002). Convivir groups received government licenses but their members remained anonymous even to local authorities (Human Rights Watch 2009). A news source reports that they were to be financed by rural surveillance and security funds; another news source says they received funds by landowners. The Colombian Constitutional Court declared the group legal, and regulated what they were legally allowed to do.";"Some paramilitary members transitioned to the legal Convivir, where they were joined by victims of guerrilla aggression. Existing Convivir groups threatened individuals that rejected joining htem.

In 1994, Carlos Casta<U+00F1>o created the Córdoba and Urab<U+00E1> Peasant Self-Defence Forces (the so-called ACCU). He expanded rapidly and gained influence within the paramilitaries. In April 1997 the ACCU met with delegations of paramilitary groups operating independently nationwide and the AUC emerged as a new umbrella organisation (Internatioal Crisis Group). It included PGMs such as Muerte a Secuestradores (Human Rights Watch), informal paramilitary groups and members of high-rank drug cartels. A news source reports that 150 groups attended the AUC founding conference.";"The main purpose of the AUC was counterinsurgency, by combating guerilla groups and protecting the economic interests of its sponsors against the guerilla. They fulfilled this purpose as they directly attacked FARC members and suspected guerilla supporters (Stanford). The military allegedly used the AUC to delegate them the task of murdering peasants and labor union leaders, as well as others suspected of supporting the guerilla (Wikipedia).";"PGM size estimations differ widely. Upon foundation in April 1997, the AUC had nearly 4,000 combatants. Membership increased steadily over time; they had around 6,800 in May 1998 and 8,000 by 2000. In 2002, there were some 12,000 combatants (International Crisis Group). Wikipedia reports that the AUC had about 20,000 members. News sources usually estimate a number close to 8,000 in 2000; Stanford estimates for 2000 more than 30,000 members. News sources estimate that in 2001 the group had 10,560 fighters and by 2003 more than 13,000 members. Another news source reports that by 2006 around 32,000 paramilitaries had demobilized.";"The AUC intimidated and controlled some local candidates and thereby got hold on public funds (International Crisis Group). In the para-politics scandal evidence surged 11,000 governors, congressmen, lawmakers and other public officials had pacted with the AUC in return for protection against guerrillas (Stanford). The AUC also had very close connections to the military and was sometimes called the military’s sixth division (the armed forces only had 5 official divisions) (Wikipedia). Until 2004, the AUC leader was the well-known paramilitary Carlos Casta<U+00F1>o. In 2004, he was murdered by the AUC’s head of security after he was increasingly perceived as risk by AUC members. His brother, Vicente Casta<U+00F1>o became the new leader (Stanford). The AUC was financed by landowners and companies who paid them in return for protection; the AUC also relied heavily on drug trade for finances (Wikipedia). They received nearly $1.7million between 1997-2004 from the Chiquita Brands company (International Crisis Group). A news source reports that the AUC’s cooptation of elites went so far as that they had helped elect the 2002 government and that around 70 congressmen won their seats because of AUC support.";"AUC members were able to seize prized farmland and engage heavily in cocaine-trafficking.";32000;"The AUC was made up of around 10 regional blocks of self defence groups, including the Self Defence Force of Cordoba and Uraba (ACCU) and the Camila Front, and was further divided in smaller branches like the Bloque Cacique Nutibara, the Centauros Bloc, the Heroes de Llano or the Bloque Central Bolvar, all in all around 37 sub-groups.

"336";466;"Shabiha";"Syria";652;"Asia";"The Shabiha emerged in the 1970s in the city of Latakia. They were mainly mafia-like gangs engaged in smuggling, protection rackets and other criminal activities. They had close links to members of the Assad family and shared the earnings of their criminality with the regime in exchange for impunity. They were mobilised between 1979 and 1982 by President Bashar al-Assad’s father against Muslim Brotherhood rebels. Several times the regime sought to curb the Shabiha’s power. News sources diverge on whether the Shabiha were disbanded in 2000 or whether the regime just curbed, but never disbanded the groups. There is little known about the Shabiha’s activities in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2011, Mr Makhlouf and Maher al-Assad, the president's brother, organized the revival of the Shabiha in the wake of anti-government protests. They transformed the Shabiha from primarily a smuggling gang into a violent militia.";"From 1979 to 1982, President Hafiz al-Assad used the Shabiha in a campaign against Muslim Brotherhood rebels. When the Shabiha were revived in 2011, their main purpose shifted to attacking and intimidating anti-regime protesters and opposition members. They are used by the regime so that the government can deny being involved in the violence; this goes so far that the Shabiha have been trained in the use of chemical weapons so that the government could deny its involvement if the Shabiha mounted a chemical weapon attack. The Shabiha also support the Syrian army in general, in a context of a shortage of recruits to the army.";"In 2012, news sources estimate the group size between 70,000 to 100,000. In 2013, one news source estimates that the group had a hundred thousand members, while another news source puts the number at 50,000. A typical Shabiha unit in the capital comprises 20 to 25 fighters.";"The Shabiha has close links to members of the Assad family and already during the time in which they were primarily a smuggling group they shared their proceeds with the regime. Maher al-Assad, the President’s younger brother, heads the Shabiha militia. Other leaders include Fawwaz, Munzir and Numir Assad, cousins of the President.  One news source mentions Dhu al-Hemma al-Shalish, the director of presidential security and also a cousin of the President, as the key organizer and financer of the Shabiha.  Another news source suggests that President Assad himself was involved in controlling the Shabiha. The Shabiha are reported to take orders from intelligence officers, especially the Air Force Intelligence Directorate. They cooperate with the military and the military gives the Shabiha cover and escort them in tanks. When the Shabiha are sent to targeted regions, they are led by members of the Fourth Division, the Republican Guard, Hezbollah, and Iranian advisers. Commanders fly to Damascus every six month to report and receive hit lists.";"Most members are poor young men belonging to Assad’s Alawite sect. They are described as very loyal to Assad and being motivated to defend their own security. In west Damascus, Shabiha members live in housings built for them by Hafez al-Assad in the 1980s; they are said to pay back their debt to the regime by suppressing protests as part of the Shabiha. Additionally, many are members for economic motives: Foot soldiers earn a fortune for a day’s thuggery. In several cases, men were released from prison (including from death row) in exchange for joining the Shabiha. In Aleppo, the government made a deal with the Sunni Berri clan who joined as Shabiha; they received amnesty for their imprisoned drug clan members, as well as arms and salaries to ensure their future loyalty. One news source reports a member who received threats against his family if he would not join the Shabiha. Another news source mentions a member who joined to avenge a friend killed by rebels.";1e+05;"Sources indicate that especially after the civilian uprising in 2011, both the press and the opposition increasingly used the term ""Shabiha"" as catchall phrase for all Syrian pro-government militias.

"351";481;"Kamajors";"Sierra Leone";451;"Africa";"The Kamajor militia is the largest and most effective group of the Civil Defence Forces (CDF), which gained importance after the coup staged by Captain Valentine Strasser against President Joseph Saidu Momoh in April 1992. The idea of having CDFs fight on the battlefront came from the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), which was a regime put into place by army officers after the coup of 1992. Due to the difficulties of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) to respond to RUF tactics and seemingly having little experience in jungle warfare, the NPRC leadership sought services of traditional hunters due to their superior knowledge of the terrain.
The CDFs were created “bottom-up” by local leaders in southern and eastern provinces as a response to the rebel menace. An example of such a local leader is Dr Alpha Lavalie, a History Lecturer who left his position at the Fourah Bay College to train young men in Kenema District and could protect their settlements (Alie 2005: 54,55).
The Kamajors transformed themselves into an anti-SLA, anti-RUF and pro-government resistance movement.";"The main purpose of the Kamajors is the provision of security for citizens and self-defence from RUF rebels and defecting SLA soldiers. The group largely refused official incorporation into the armed forces of the state. Their goal was to protect the state against its enemies, whoever they were. The movement emerged at a critical period, when the state apparatus was very weak. The Kamajor force revived the state and provided some sense of security and civil authority where they were lacking (Alie 2005: 63). The Kamajors took on tasks that the SLA could not perform as they were ineffective and suffered from defections and disloyalty . Also, oftentimes the local CDF, among them the Kamajors, knew the terrain much better and could therefore protect civilians more effectively.

The Kamajor militia scored major successes against the RUF. For example they overran the main RUF base – Camp Zogoda – in Kenema District in mid-1996. During that same year, they liberated all chiefdoms in Pujehun District. These major accomplishments may have forced the RUF to the negotiating table in 1996 (Alie 2005: 55-58).";"Between 1995 and 1998 the number of initiates into the Kamajor society increased dramatically. The proliferation also brought new challenges: e.g. many young men of doubtful character became members, there was a loss of discipline and some members brought the name of the movement into disrepute (Alie 2005: 58).";"The militia groups owed allegiance to various local leaders but not to a national body. Many Kamajor leaders openly boasted that they had rescued the state and were therefore beyond its control. Some even disregarded state authority with impunity.
The Kamajor National Coordinator, Chief Sam Hinga Norman, was appointed Deputy Defence Minister in 1996. He was arrested in March 2003 when he was Minister of Internal Affairs and along with him the Kamajor’s high priest Aliu Kundorwai and their former Director of War Moinina Fofana. The Special Court incarcerated all of them for crimes against humanity which contributed to the sentiment of many Kamajors of inadequate reward for their efforts during the civil conflict (Alie 2005: 58/65).";"In order to join the Kamajor movement, youths were nominated by their chiefdom authorities for initiation carried out by high priests. Different reasons drove members to joining the Kamajors: patriotism and the desire to protect homelands and property, a necessity as joining the movement provided security, the desire to avenge the death of loved ones or adventure (Alie 2005: 57).";40000;"From 1997 on large factions of the Kamajor militia were mobilised to join a newly formed Civil Defense Force, comprised of various militias. Various Kamajor groups in various regions however, continued fighting outside this combined force.";"southern and eastern regions, Freetown, Kenema, Waterloo, Bo, Massingbi";"yr";NA;"The Kamajors mainly used single-barrelled shotguns or home-made guns (Alie 2005: 56/63). Some Kamajors were trained by local leaders. After being initiated into the Kamajor society, the militiamen were schooled in modern weapons handling. However, the civil militia forces, to which the Kamajors belonged, did not receive rigorous conventional military training. Their military training was rudimentary and their members had little or no knowledge of the rules governing modern warfare (Alie 2005: 52).
Another part of rendering initiates fit to serve at the war front was granting them special powers, such as being ‘bullet-proof’ or being able to smell enemies (Alie 2005: 55-57).";"";"ECOMOG";"dy";"In some towns in the south and east of the country, local authorities had become targets of the RUF and had run away for safety reasons. Soon after liberating these towns, local Kamajor leaders constituted themselves into a government. Their functions were collecting taxes, imposing fines and extorting money and other items from the people. Reports of atrocities such as rape, looting and even ritual murder became routine. The Kamajors simultaneously preyed on and protected civilians. Occasionally, the Kamajor leadership made attempts to punish violators. Most misdeeds of the Kamajor militia were committed during periods of military rule (NPRC from 1992 – March 1996 and AFRC from May 1997 – February 1998). These different administrations were powerless in curbing the Kamajors excesses. Civilians accused of collaborating with the AFRC regime were captured and often killed by Kamajors. Without condoning their violence, the Kamajors were operating within a hostile environment, in which it was not always easy to distinguish between friend and foe. Despite their serious shortcomings, many people appreciated their invaluable role in defending their communities (Alie 2005: 62).";0;"Alie, Joe. 2005. The Kamajor Militia in Sierra Leone: Liberators or Nihilists? In David J. Francis (ed.) Civil Militia: Africa’s intractable security menace? Aldershot: Ashgate, 51-70.";"The civil conflict officially came to an end in January 2002, and all parties – RUF, CDF, SLA and others - pledged to uphold the peace process. The Kamajors participated in the disarmament process and many returned to their settlements to continue their prewar activities. Although there is little evidence for this view, many Kamajors were suspected of not disarming, but secretly hiding their weapons. In the early stages of the disarmament process, many Kamajors did not meet the eligibility criteria for entry into the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme. One such requirement was that a combatant had to have a conventional weapon, not home-made guns that many Kamajors used. It is also rumoured that some Kamajors may have crossed over to Liberia with their weapons to act as mercenaries and thereby threatening the security situation in the region.

In an attempt to overhaul the security apparatus, some institutions were revised or established by the Sierra Leone Government. There have been disagreements over the decision on whether to include the CDF, and therefore also the Kamajors, within the new security framework. Eventually, the government decided to exclude the CDF. However, they acknowledged the active support the CDF gave the SLA during the conflict as well as the potential need in the future for some form of part-time reserve force that is fully integrated into the command structure of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF). Although many Kamajors were angry and frustrated, because they did not feel adequately rewarded and appreciated in their role during the civil conflict, they remained largely peaceful and law-abiding. They refrained from seriously challenging state authority in the post-conflict period (Alie 2005: 63, 64).";2001;1992-01-01;1992;1;1;2002-01-17;2002;1;17;2002;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;53;19;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;NA;"";NA;"";NA;"";NA;"";NA;NA;NA;NA;1;1;2;2;1;1;2;2;1;1;3;0;1;3;3;1;1;3

Some trace the origin back to the time when Brigades with that name launched attacks against US and coalition troops in 2005 – 2008 in Iraq, and that it then became part of the Kataeb Hezbollah. Another news source says that Mahdi army fighters had fled from Iraq after being fought by the US in 2007 and that these fighters, in coordination with the Syrian government and Khamenei’s office in Damascus, founded the brigade. Yet another source suggests that the group was founded in Iraq in 2012, after a fatwa issued by the renowned cleric Abu al-Qasim al-Ta’ai, who called for volunteers to fight in Syria. According to Reuters, the Brigade was set up in 2012 in a response to the perceived Sunni threat against Shia shrines (Reuters 2013).";"The official purpose of the PGM is to protect the Sayyida Zeinab shrine near Damascus (Reuters 2013).

The presence of the Brigade in the surroundings of the Sayyida Zeinab shrine makes the Syrian army’s presence unnecessary. The group is sometimes sent to front lines in Damascus suburbs because the government needs additional troops.";"At the beginning, the group had around 500 fighters. Numbers quickly surged to 10,000 volunteers, according to a news source from 2013. Other estimates continue to suggest numbers between 500 to 1,500 fighters (Smyth 2013) or 800 to 2,000 fighters (The Washington Institute 2013).";"According to one news source, the Abbas Brigade is under the supervision of commanders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. One news source mentions that the Brigade’s commander is Abu Ajeeb; another source calls the commander Abu Ajil. According to that latter source, the command is led by Syrian Shabiha loyalists from Assad’s Alawite clan. Members who join the brigade also have to join the Syrian government army and fight for Assad before fighting for the brigade.";"Many members are volunteers from Iraq who were motivated by the fatwa by the cleric Abu al-Qasim al-Ta'ai, who called for Shia to fight in Syria.

Uy provided payment and equipment for the operations, channeling it through the Civil Security Unit (CSU) as a cover. Most TDS members were employed under a cover of legitimacy as security aides to the Tagum City governments’ CSU. TDS members sometimes received killing orders from then-CSU chief Col Abraham Catre, a retired police official. TDS supervisors were Victor Cuaresma, Conrado Palen and Sabitsana. Uy, Cuaresma or Palen would contact Sabitsana with a killing order who would then get in touch with TDS members. Sometimes the supervisors ordered killings without Uy’s knowledge and control, in order to generate personal revenue. (Human Rights Watch 2014)";"The majority of TDS members were petty criminals that were recruited into the TDS after they themselves had run in with the law on minor offenses. Most were jobless youths. TDS members who refused to carry out orders or wanted to quit were likely to become TDS victims. There are several reports of TDS members who were targeted by fellow TDS. Many escaped heavily wounded, but a handful was killed over time. Additionally to their regular Civil Security Unit salary, they received payments for every killing their conducted.

The RSF abuses were systematic and are considered to amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. They often acted together with the Sudanese army. RSF members were ordered by their commanders to commit the crimes: Commander Hemeti ordered to abuse women and Sudanese Vice President Hassabo Mohammed Abdel Rahman directly addressed the army and the RSF and told them to kill any men they encountered (Human Rights Watch 2015).

In 2008, Sadr shifted the Mahdi army’s focus away from military activity to providing social services. In 2010/2011 Sadr’s party Iraqi National Alliance, made up of Mahdi army members, became part of the government. However, there is no evidence that the group was armed and a militia during that time.

Its members continued to follow Sadr and in June 2014 Sadr created the Mahdi army again, albeit under a different name, Peace Brigades (Stanford Mapping Militant Organizations 2017).

He called, supported by a fatwa (religious edict) of the supreme Shi’a religious cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, for volunteers to join existing and new Shia militias, which were grouped into the newly founded PMF umbrella PGM.";"The main purpose of the PMF is to fight the Islamic State (Amnesty International). They were successful in fulfilling this purpose. The PGM was founded in the context of the failure of the regular Iraqi security apparatus. The PMF is considered more efficient and more reliable than the regular army. Maliki also used the PMF against political opposition. One of the reasons why Prime Minister Abadi accepted the PGM was that the army was no longer able to protect holy sites, while the PMF could.";"There are no official statistics on the size of the PMF. However, it is estimated that 40 to 50 militias participate in the umbrella PGM (Amnesty International 2017). In 2014, group size was somewhat over 60,000 members, with some sources estimating a membership of up to 140,000 (Carnegie 2017). In 2016, there were, according to different sources, between 110,000 to 142,000 fighters in the PMF (Amnesty International 2017, Carnegie 2017). There are more volunteers than the PGM has capacity to accept, so many recruits remain inactive and are not officially listed as active fighters. The roughly subgroups vary in size from a few hundreds to tens of thousands of members each (Carnegie 2017).";"According to media reports, the PMF is headed by National Security Advisor, Falah Fayyad. It is administered by the Popular Mobilization Commission (PMC) which is a government body (Amnesty International 2017). The Commission is directly attached to the Prime Minister’s office. However, real power over the Commission lies with the Ministry of Interior, which is managed by the Badr Organization. The Commission is led by Abu Mehdi al-Muhandis and Hadi al-Ameri, both members of the pro-Khamenei faction. They are in control of the funds and indirectly of the number of volunteers in the PMF; Prime Minister Abadi has de facto no control over the funds. Abadi had to accept the status quo of the PMF because the army remained weak and the PMF enjoyed a very large public support. By becoming part of the PMF, militias gained legitimacy and could operate in public with full state funding (Carnegie 2017).";"Many fighters were motivated by the fatwa issued by Sistani as they wanted to fulfill what they perceived to be their religious duty. The fatwa had transformed the PMF into a sacred institution and it enjoyed almost complete support within the Shia population. A large proportion of the (Shia) population then volunteered for membership. Other reasons for membership were that conscription was easier and faster than for regular forces, and that the PMF seemed to be the more efficient and less corrupt fighting force, having better equipment than the military. Shia Turkmen joined the PMF in a quest for increasing their autonomy relative to the Kurds and to counter those having joined the IS (Carnegie 2017). The PMF recruited child soldiers (Amnesty International 2017); it is not clear whether they used coercion to that end.";140000;"The PMF is also known as Popular Mobilization Units or Hashd Shaabi. The PMF is an umbrella PGM that includes other PGMs such as the Badr Brigades, Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq or the Peace Brigades (Amnesty International 2017).
